# Introduction 👋
Hey there! Thanks for visiting. If you're an anime enthusiast like me, you're in for a treat! This site was inspired by my favorite online anime platforms. I aimed to recreate their design and functionality using fundamental front-end development skills.

# How did I approach this project? 
### Planning 📝
I began by outlining clear project goals and defining the target audience—anime enthusiasts like myself. Understanding user expectations helped in shaping the website's design and functionality.

### Design Inspiration 🎨
Inspired by leading online anime platforms, I conducted thorough research to identify design elements and user interfaces that resonate with anime fans. This guided the aesthetic direction of the project.

### Front-end Development 💼 
Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing interface. Rather than frameworks, I opted for lightweight plugins to enhance interactivity, such as jQuery for animations and Slick Carousel for dynamic content display.

### Iterative Development 🔁
Adopting an iterative approach, I continuously tested and refined features based on user feedback and usability testing. This ensured a user-centric design that prioritized intuitive navigation and seamless functionality across devices.

### Collaboration and Version Control ✍️
Throughout development, I utilized Git and GitHub for version control, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a structured workflow. This streamlined the development process and allowed for easy integration of new features and bug fixes.

        <h2>To You, In 2000 Years</h2>
        <p>The story of the Titans begins over 1800 years before the aforementioned premiere is set. The first Titan, a young girl
        named Ymir, once lived a provincial life in a small village. Everything changed when a warrior tribe called the Eldians
        attacked. The villagers were either killed or enslaved; Ymir was one of the "lucky" latter ones. In the year 1003 BI (1848 years before "To You, In 2000 Years" begins in 845), Ymir let her masters' pigs escape. The
        Eldian King Fritz set her "free" but commanded his warriors to hunt her like an animal. The injured Ymir took refuge in
        an enormous tree, where she fell into a pool of water. She might have drowned if not for a mysterious creature
        resembling a cross between a centipede and disembodied nervous system. The creature bonded with Ymir, turning her into
        the first Titan. Ymir's transformation spared her life, but she was still a slave. For the next 13 years, she joined conquests in King
        Fritz's name, bringing nations, including the sea-faring Marleyans, to heel with her power. She also became the king's
        concubine, bearing him three daughters: Rose, Maria, and Sheena. Before we continue, let's talk about the real-world parallels. The brutal state of the ancient "AOT" world resembles the
        Viking age. The Eldians' outfits and culture are modeled on Germanic and Nordic tribes, while the ancient Marleyans seem
        more Greco-Roman. The Eldians' conquest of Marleyans is like the fall of Rome, only the Visigoths probably didn't have a
        giant woman helping them. Ymir's own name is taken from the first giant of Norse mythology, while the tree where she is transformed is analogous
        to Yggdrasil, the tree which binds the nine realms in Norse myths</p>

    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
       <h2>Era of the Edian Empire</h2>
       <p>13 years after Ymir became a Titan, she was killed saving Fritz from assassination by Marleyans. To preserve her power,
        Fritz fed her remains to their daughters. Filtered through generations, nine distinct Titans emerged. Ymir's own power
        became called the Founding Titan and was passed down through her and Fritz's direct descendants; only those of royal
        blood can wield its powers. There are eight others: the Attack Titan, the Armored Titan, the Colossal Titan, the Female
        Titan, the Jaw Titan, the Cart Titan, the Beast Titan, and the War Hammer Titan. Implicitly due to Ymir's own premature
        death, holders of Titan powers expire after 13 years. This resulted in ritualistic inheritance by way of cannibalism.
        For the next millennium plus, the Eldians ruled the world with the power of Titans. The Nine are distributed among
        Eldian Nobles while "Pure" Titans (mindless, less powerful variants who can't change at will) become shock troops.
        Nations are either enslaved, like Marley, or become subordinate allies, such as Hizuru (an East-Asian-inspired country).
        Particular events during the Eldian Empire's reign include an Eldian blitzkrieg against Marley in 371 B1 (dubbed the
        "Fall of Lago," the "Devastation of Monte," and the "Ravaging of Valle") and a plague outbreak in Year 240. The current
        Eldian king alters his people's biology with the Founding Titan's power, making them immune. This time span also sees
        the birth of the Ackerman clan, who thanks to scientific experimentation are super-soldiers in human form and become the
        royal family's bodyguards. Centuries of uncontested Eldian rule led to civil war, where the holders of the nine vied for dominance. This "Great
        Titan War" spelled the empire's end.</p>

    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h2>Fall of Eldians</h2>
        <p>The 145th Eldian King, Karl Fritz, is aghast by his people's legacy of violence and the suffering they've caused. To
        repent, he decides to orchestrate his own empire's fall. The King conspires in secret with the Tybur family, holders of
        the War Hammer Titan. Fritz and the Tyburs fabricate a story about a Marleyan named "Helos" slaying "the Devil of all
        Earth," the imagined, Marleyan version of the creature which gave Ymir her power.
        The Tyburs then side with Marley against the remaining Eldian houses, while Fritz takes the royal family and many other
        Eldians to the island Paradis. Using the Founder's power, he creates millions of Colossal Titans who together form three
        walls: Maria, Rose, and Sheena. The Titans' "hardening" ability gives the walls the appearance of the stone. These walls
        are to keep both other nations out and the Eldians in.
        Playing the part of a sore loser, Fritz warns the world that if they come to Paradis, he will break down the walls and
        unleash the Colossal Titans on the world. In truth, this is an empty threat. To make sure no Eldians venture outside the
        walls, Fritz erases his people's collective memory, making them believe they're the last of humanity and the Pure Titans
        outside the walls eradicated everyone else.
        Not all of those inside the walls have their memories erased. The Ackermans prove immune, as does the family of a Hizuru
        shogun who came to Paradis (the Hizuruans are not "Subjects of Ymir" after all). These clans are then hunted to near
        extinction.</p>

    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h2>The walls of Paradis</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, the royal family goes underground, placing a puppet king on the throne while they rule in secret as the
        "Reiss" family. For the next century, the Founding Titan and the memories of its holders are passed down through the
        Reiss family. Its holders thus inherit not just Karl Fritz's power, but also his pacifist ideology, ensuring that none
        of them ever set lose the Wall Titans to rebuild the Empire. A military is established within the walls, made up of three branches: the military police, the Garrison Corps (focused
        on internal security), and the Survey Corps aka Scout Regiment (who venture beyond the walls to slay Titans). In the
        years 778-793 (chronicled in the "Before the Fall" light novels), Angel Aaltonen and Xenophon Harkimo develop
        Omni-directional mobility (ODM) gear, a gas-propelled grappling harness that enables Survey Corps members to fight
        Titans. It's also during this century that the main characters in "Attack on Titan" are born. For one, the Ackerman clan barely
        endures. In Year 829, one of the last Ackermans, Kenny, befriends Uri Reiss. Kenny assumes the role of his ancestors as
        the royal family's bodyguard. Kenny then discovers his sister Kuchel died while working in a brothel and adopts her son
        Levi. Levi eventually abandons his uncle to become a street criminal. In 835, Rod Reiss fathers an illegitimate daughter, Historia. The same year, another Ackerman marries a descendant of
        the Hizuru clan, merging the two bloodlines in their daughter Mikasa. Mikasa's parents are killed by slave traders in
        844, but she is saved by a boy her age, Eren Yeager. The Yeagers adopt Mikasa, but there's more to this family than
        meets the eye.</p>

        <h2>The Clash of the Titans</h2>
        <p>The same day as the Stohess battle, Marleyan soldiers make landfall in Paradis and turn the village of Ragako into pure
        Titans, who Zeke commands as the Beast Titan. Hange's interrogation of a local minister, Nick, about the Titan in the
        wall is interrupted when Scouts misreport Zeke's Titans as a sign that Wall Rose has been breached. Commander Zacharias
        is killed by the Beast Titan while his squad rests at the nearby castle Utgard. That night, they're attacked by Titans:
        the only survivors are Reiner, Bertholdt, "Krista," and Ymir, thanks to the latter revealing her Titan powers. Historia
        reveals her true name to Ymir afterward. The Survey corps arrives from Stohess and brings the Utgard survivors to Wall Rose, where the Garrison corps reveals
        there's no breach. Reiner and Bertholdt reveal themselves and abduct Eren and Ymir. Five hours later, the Scouts and
        Garrison, led by Erwin Smith, set out to Wall Maria to rescue the Titan shifters.They succeed in rescuing Eren, but Ymir decides to stay with Reiner and Bertholdt. To cut off the Scouts' escape, Reiner
        throws Pure Titans at them, including the Smiling Titan that ate Eren's mother. When Eren attacks the Smiling Titan,
        he's able to command the other Titans to eat it; Dina Fritz's royal blood triggered the power of the founder in Eren.
        40 soldiers from the Scouts and Garrison survive (Erwin loses his right arm to a Titan bite) and return to Wall Rose,
        while the shifters continue to Wall Maria. Ymir is shipped back to Marley and devoured by Porco Galliard so he can
        inherit the Jaw Titan, but leaves behind a letter for Historia with Reiner.</p>

    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <h2>The Rumbling</h2>
        <p>Eren and Zeke awaken in "the paths," or the dimension where Ymir's soul resides and where time passes much more slowly.
        After a trip through the memories of their father and Ymir the Founder, Eren convinces the latter to give him control of
        the Founding Titan. Eren breaks down the walls of Paradis and telepathically announces to all Eldians his plan to
        destroy all life outside Paradis. 80% of the world's populace was wiped out in the Rumbling. Over the next three years, the former shifters (Armin,
        Reiner, Annie, Pieck) are made into Marleyan ambassadors alongside Connie and Jean. In 857, they return to Paradis. Levi
        chooses to settle in Marley, while Mikasa returns to Shiganshina and buries Eren under a tree they played on as
        children. Over the next decades, Mikasa starts a family and occasionally brings them to visit Eren's grave.
        The last few pages of "Attack on Titan" Chapter 139 jump forward generations across panels. Mikasa dies of old age in
        roughly Year 915. At least a few decades after that, Paradis has reached 21st-century technology level and Shiganshina
        is now made up of modern skyscrapers. Alas, war has again come to the island: a fleet of aerial bombers destroy the city
        as part of a new, unknown conflict. Even as buildings fall, the tree stands.
        More decades pass and the rubble of Shiganshina is reclaimed by the forest. One day, a child and their dog hike through
        the ruins and come to the base of the tree, now a cavern, like the one Ymir found all those centuries ago. The end of
        one war is not the end of mankind's capacity to wage war, personified by the Titans. The cycle of violence is bound by
        an unbreakable chain, one that's reached long past the two thousand years that "Attack on Titan" spans.</p>
